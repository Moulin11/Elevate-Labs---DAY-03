##Short Explanation

Cloud Storage Buckets are used by companies to store, organize, and manage data such as images, videos, documents, logs, and backups.
They provide secure, scalable, and cost-efficient access to data from anywhere, supporting both private and public storage needs.

##Real-World Use Cases
1. Web Hosting

Companies use cloud storage to host static websites and assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images).
This allows for fast global delivery and high availability without needing physical servers.

2. Data Backup & Recovery

Businesses regularly back up their databases, applications, and system logs to cloud buckets.
In case of data loss, quick restoration is possible, ensuring business continuity.

3. Media Streaming & File Sharing

Platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, or Spotify store large volumes of media files in cloud storage.
This enables on-demand streaming, secure access, and efficient content delivery across regions.

4. Machine Learning & Big Data

AI/ML teams use cloud buckets to store training datasets and large-scale analytics data.
This supports collaboration, automated pipelines, and integration with AI services.
